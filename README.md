## Overview

Welcome to **AI-assistant for a Coffee Haus**, a solution designed to enhance customer interactions and streamline operations in your coffee shop. This project leverages advanced AI technologies to create an intelligent assistant capable of engaging in meaningful conversations, answering questions based on a knowledge base, and managing reservations by integrating with Google Calendar.

## Key Features

1. **Conversational AI**  
   The assistant engages in natural, human-like dialogues powered by a neural network. It can handle customer inquiries, provide recommendations, and assist with orders seamlessly.

2. **Knowledge Base Integration**  
   Equipped with a comprehensive knowledge base, the assistant can answer frequently asked questions about the menu, promotions, store policies, and more. This ensures consistent and accurate information delivery.

3. **Reservation Management**  
   Customers can book tables or schedule appointments through the assistant. Reservations are automatically added to your **Google Calendar**, ensuring real-time updates and efficient scheduling.

## Technologies Used

- **Qwen**:  
  - Created a system prompt tailored for coffee shop interactions.  
  - Developed a robust knowledge base to support the assistant's responses.  

- **Savvy (https://app.suvvy.ai/)**:  
  - Built the AI assistant using Savvy's intuitive platform.  
  - Enabled seamless integration of conversational AI with external tools like Google Calendar.

## How It Works

1. **Customer Interaction**:  
   Customers interact with the assistant via a chat interface. The assistant uses its neural network to understand queries and respond appropriately.

2. **Knowledge Retrieval**:  
   For specific questions, the assistant retrieves information from the pre-built knowledge base, ensuring accurate and reliable answers.

3. **Reservation Handling**:  
   When a customer requests a reservation, the assistant collects necessary details (e.g., date, time, number of guests) and syncs the booking with your Google Calendar.

## Use Cases

- **Customer Support**: Reduce workload on staff by automating responses to common queries.  
- **Reservation Management**: Simplify table bookings and avoid double bookings with real-time calendar updates.  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Enhance customer experience by suggesting drinks or snacks based on preferences.
- **Multilingual Support**: Expand the assistant's capabilities to serve customers in multiple languages.
